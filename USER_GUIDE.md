- **Swipe Down:** Move cursor backward
- **Two-finger swipes:** Advanced editing commands

### Settings

Access settings from:

- Or perform specific gesture while keyboard is active

Configure:
- Braille table (language and grade)
- **Contraction Braille (Grade 2):** For faster input using English contractions
- Keyboard orientation and style
- Feedback preferences (vibration, sound, speech)
- Echo settings (character, word, or both)

#### Using Contraction Braille (Grade 2)

The keyboard now fully supports English contraction braille tables:
- **en-UEB-g2:** Unified English Braille Grade 2 with contractions
- **en-US-g2:** US English Grade 2 with contractions

To enable contraction braille:
1. Open keyboard Settings
2. Go to **Braille Table**
3. Select **Literary (Grade 1/2)** as the braille type
4. Choose **en-UEB-g2** or **en-US-g2** from the table list
5. Use standard braille contractions for faster typing

Contraction braille allows you to type common words and letter combinations more quickly using standard Grade 2 contractions.

## Screen Reader Compatibility

### Using with TalkBack or Other Screen Readers

**Good News:** The keyboard now includes an optional Accessibility Service for seamless integration!

The keyboard works perfectly with:
- ✅ Google TalkBack
- ✅ Android Voice Assistant
- ✅ Third-party screen readers
- ✅ BrailleBack
- ✅ Any other accessibility service

#### Enabling the Accessibility Service (Recommended for TalkBack Users)

For the best experience with TalkBack:

1. Go to Android **Settings** → **Accessibility**
2. Find **Soft Braille Keyboard** in the list of services
3. Enable the **Soft Braille Keyboard Accessibility Service**
4. Grant the requested permissions

**What does this do?**
- Prevents conflicts between TalkBack's touch exploration and multi-touch braille input
- Ensures smooth recognition of dots 1, 2, 3 and all other braille combinations
- Provides better overall integration with screen readers
- Does NOT interfere with TalkBack's normal operation

**Note:** This is optional. The keyboard will work without it, but enabling the service provides a smoother multi-touch experience.

**When touch exploration is enabled**, you'll receive:
- Helpful spoken instructions
- Clear descriptions of UI elements
- Guidance on how to use the keyboard

### Without Screen Readers

The keyboard works equally well without any screen reader:
- Visual indicators show dot positions (if enabled)
- Tactile feedback through vibration
- Audio feedback through system sounds

## Tips for Best Experience

### For Screen Reader Users

1. **Enable the Accessibility Service:** Go to Android Settings → Accessibility and enable the Soft Braille Keyboard service for better multi-touch support
2. **Enable helpful descriptions:** The keyboard provides audio guidance when you hover over it
3. **Learn the gestures:** Swipe gestures are announced when you use them
4. **Customize feedback:** Adjust speech, vibration, and sound in settings
5. **Use the practice field:** Try the keyboard in the app's practice area first
6. **Try Grade 2 Braille:** If you're familiar with contractions, enable Grade 2 (en-UEB-g2 or en-US-g2) for faster typing

### For All Users

1. **Explore settings:** Customize the keyboard to your preferences
2. **Learn braille codes:** The keyboard uses standard braille codes for your language
3. **Use voice input:** Quick double-swipe gesture activates voice input (requires permission)
4. **Privacy mode:** Enable to hide what you're typing from onlookers
